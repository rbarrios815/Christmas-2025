# Christmas-2025

Apps Script web app for the Christmas 2025 sign-up.

- `Code.gs` serves the HTML and connects to the Google Sheet backend.
- `index.html` is the template rendered by the web app (served via `HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('index')`).
- `docs/index.html` is a copy of the template so GitHub Pages can serve a preview; keep it in sync with `index.html` when making changes.
